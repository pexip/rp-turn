# Cloud-init

There are a few existing cloud-init scripts defined in this repo. Some of them can be used as-is, whereas other are more
of a template. You could also form your own cloud-init script from scratch using the others scripts as a reference.

## installer

This cloud-init script can be used as-is to produce the Pexip Reverse Proxy/TURN server in a way to give a fresh out of
the box experience.
